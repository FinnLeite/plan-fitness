# plan-fitness
The purpose of this project is to keep track of workouts in Personal Fitness. The project connects to both Personal Fitness and Computer Science courses, because of the use of Personal Fitness terminology and the use of HTML and JavaScript to create the project. I was inspired to make the project because it is easy to forget which exercises you need to do, and this website will help to keep track of exercises while working out. The countdown timer is useful because it lets you know how much time is left in class.
